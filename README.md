# Fish to MIPS Compiler

This is a work in progress compiler for a simplified Fortran like language called Fish.

## Getting Started

Run the following to install project dependencies:

```bash
opam install ppx_deriving ppx_sexp_conv sexp
```

Run the following to install the MIPS simulator:

```bash
brew install spim
```

Run the following to build the project:

```bash
make
```

## How to test your code

To compile all .fish files in the test directory, run the following:

```bash
./run_all.sh
```

Assuming you have spim installed, you can also run the following to execute the MIPS assembly code generated by your compiler located in the `compiled` directory.

```bash
./run_asm.sh [filename]
```

You can also `run_asm` without arguments to execute all the MIPS code in compiled with the outputs stored in the `output` directory.
